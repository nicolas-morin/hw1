    <h1>Part 1: Nutrition</h1>
    <p>
        According to <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/obesity-and-overweight">the World Health Organization</a> 
        <b>Worldwide Obesity has nearly tripled since 1975</b> <br>
        We have been eating way too much and are not taking care of the basics when it comes to Nutrition. <br>
        While many believe that you need to crunch until you die to get abs, it actually stars with proper Nutrition. <br>
        The reason we are confused when it comes to what to eat and what is actually good and bad for you is not our fault.
        <b>Industries and their lobbies have been blurring reality.</b> They’ve been promoting a way of dieting that <b>sabotages our health and well-being. </b>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        They’ve made food cheaper. But they’ve also made it more processed, fattier, with more sugar, and with no nutrients at all. <b>So we’re becoming sicker</b> and spending more on healthcare.

    <h2>Something is very wrong! </h2>

    <p>
        Studies of various tribal peoples cut off from modern technology have shown that they generally live longer, are healthier, 
        and are free of many diseases we take for granted today <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22262579/">[1]</a> <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/81/2/341/4607411">[2]</a>
    </p>

    <p>
    The way you eat influences every part of your life. Knowing about nutrition is, therefore, crucial. Understand what you’ve been doing wrong, and getting back to the basics, will allow you to make good choices and reach your goals. <br>
