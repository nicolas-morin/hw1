    <h1>Why the Personal Fit?</h1>
    <p>
        Have you ever wondered <b>why no matter how hard you try; you still keep getting disappointed by the diet you’re on?</b> <br> 
        Or do you feel like your meal plan isn’t letting you reach your full potential? Ever wanted to know why “you are what you eat?” <br>
        Are you struggling to make sense of all contradicting scientific studies? <br>
        Are you wondering about which pull-up variation is best? Or <b>how to maximize your health and gains while having only limited time for the gym?</b> 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        If you answered yes to any of these questions - you're not alone. <br>
        According to a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db313.htm"> study</a> published by the National Center for Health Statistics in 2013-2016, 49.1% of U.S. adults tried to lose weight in the last 12 months
        My goal is to help you <b>know more, perform better, get stronger, and have a better life.</b>
    </p>

        <h2>NEWS FLASH</h2>
        <b>There's more to life than looks and muscles.</b> My focus is on strength and health, not looks.<br>
        Contrary to professional models who make their living by looking good, we all have busy lives and our time at the gym is not paid for. <br>
        But... <b>I'll teach you some of the stuff they do to look good</b> while keeping your job. I promise.

        <h2>HOW DO WE THIS?</h2>
        This website is split in several parts - all of which being pillars to support you achieving your goals. <b>If you are new to all of this</b>  (Great Job on taking that first step!).
