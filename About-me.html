    <title>The Personal Fit - About me</title>

<body>
   <h1>Hi There!</h1> 
   <p>
        I'm Nicolas, a Fitness Enthusiast, originally from France but currently living in the US.
        I'm 5"10 and 165 pounds and my goal is to be as atheltic as possible.
        I have done a triathlon but have also done a great deal of powerlifting.
        My personal PRs are:
        <ul>
            <li> 495 pounds on deadlift</li>
            <li> 400 pounds on squat</li>
            <li> 290 pounds on bench press </li>
        </ul>
        I have always been interested in sports and nutrition and I believe that you can have a functional and aesthetic body without sacrificing too much.
        Achieving that is not as hard as it might seem. In fact, a lot of it has to do with moderation.
