My goal is to create a personal website to talk about my passion for Fitness & Nutrition. The end goal is to have a functional, well-referenced website from which I can build on.
I am a self-published author (2 books published 5 years ago) and I'm actively looking to publish one condensed book that encompasses my new approach this year. The books seen in the about me page will, therefore, disappear.
I'm planning on trying to go beyond the content of the class if possible, to make sure I get a website as polished as possible.
