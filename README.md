My goal is to create a personal website to promote the 2 books I have written about Fitness & Nutrition. The end goal is to have a functional, well-referenced website from which I can build on.
I am a self-published author (2 books published 5 years ago) and I'm actively looking to publish one condensed book that encompasses my new approach this year. The books seen in the about me page will, therefore, disappear.
